# Arcade Racing

This is an arcade racing game in 8-bit style. This JavaScript game was developed to explore Vibe Coding and discover its current limitations.

Don't lose control on this randomly generated track: stay on course, avoid enemy cars and don't slip on the bananas in your Formula 1 car!

What might sound easy on a regular track, could become quite challenging when it starts raining.
